# Day 12 of 100 Days Of Code

I'm focused on learning GraphQL for Back-end and Front-end. This day, I learned the basics of GraphQL and Apollo Server and made a simple GraphQL API w/o a database, just a mock data, and connected it to a front-end react app.

## Plan:

Instead of lerning new things for my backend, I'm just going to use firebase, so that I can quickly develop apps, and cut down the time for learning and instead, use for developing
.
