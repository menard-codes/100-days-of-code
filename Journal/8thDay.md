# Day 8 of 100 Days of Code

I've been studying GraphQL with Apollo, and I just finished the basic course of it on ApolloGraphQL Introductory course.

I learned the Basics of creating a schema with gql and apollo server, as well as making it available via an API endpoint. I also loaded data on the endpoint, though it's just a mock data.

Next thing I learned is how to query a GraphQL API endpoint with React, graphql, and ApolloClient.

GraphQL is really fun to work with, and I will consider it to be part of my main development toolbox.

I just like how easy things are with GraphQL compared to REST, so for the next few days, I'm gonna learn more about it.
