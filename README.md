# 100 Days Of Code

I am commiting myself to learn software development for the next 100 days.

This is a dedicated repo for my #100DaysOfCode.

I am aiming to learn software development and expand my knowledge from react.js to full-stack development. I am planning to build a fullstack app after this.

I am also aiming to smooth out things and start out simple by abstracting the backend through firebase at start, then gradually into backend dev.

Honestly before this, I already have some knowledge of node.js and express and have made a simple REST API before, but that's a very basic and shallow understanding and I want to improve my knowledege about it.

For this challenge, I am going to use a book titled **"Software Development from A to Z A Deep Dive Into All the Roles Involved in the Creation of Software"**.

## Before the challenge

To be honest, before this challenge, I already started studying the book and I'm currently in the middle of Chapter 2 and about to start Software Development Methodologies. I think it's a good starting point to document my journey though.

## Book Contents and my target learnings

**NOTE:** *I will check things from this list after doing each one of these*

- [ ] **Waterfall model**
- [ ] **SCRUM**
- [ ] **Kanban**
- [ ] **Requirements, Commitment, and deadlines**
- [ ] **User-Centered design**
- [ ] **Backend Development**
- [ ] **Frontend Development**
- [ ] **Testing our product**
- [ ] **Deployment (Let's go live!)**
- [ ] **Maintaining and improving your software**
- [ ] **Wrapping up (Tips and Tricks)**

After this, I am planning to further my understanding of Software Development Lifecycle, and also to learn more about CI/CD.

## My Main Goal

I am aiming to learn software development to understand how to build real world softwares that users can actually use, because I am aiming to build a software based business (more of a web-based business).

By understanding the Software development process, I am aiming to understand how a software is made from an idea.

I am also going to document my coding journey on blog sites like [Dev.to](https://dev.to/menard_codes), on social media (I might start with twitter only) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/menard_codes), and here on GitHub through journals in Markdown.
